# LTEBS_2021_II_Group_11_EAGLE

**Final Version**

The purpose of this project consists in designing a PCB embedding the PSoC 5LP micro-controller in order to evaluate the performance of the micro-controller itself 
to assess if such uC is suitable for the project requested by the customer.
The deisgned PCB embeds the CY8CKIT-059, namely the development kit for the PSoC 5LP, and additional components required to perform the testing.

The project involves, in addition to the schematic and the board desing, a library containing custom components and Design Rules implemented according to the technical 
specifications reported in the website of the manufacturer, namely the MDSrl.
